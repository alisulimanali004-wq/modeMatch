ModaMatch – Fashion Outfit Recommendation Website

Project Description:

ModaMatch is a fashion outfit recommendation website that helps users browse clothing items and receive outfit suggestions based on their preferences. The system consists of a Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) and a Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB).

We implemented a simple AI Expert System that recommends outfits based on user inputs such as gender, occasion, and season using rule-based logic.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

API Communication: Axios / Fetch
